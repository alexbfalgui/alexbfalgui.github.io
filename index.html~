      My name is Alexander B. Falgui and this is my personal website. 
      <br /></br />
      
      Most of the contents you'll see are about me achieving the hacker's mind
      set and learning how to program in Python. This site is still new and
      I want you, the visitors to know that I don't intend to make this site 
      beautiful because I lack time and want to focus on the functionality of the 
      site more.<br /></br />
      
      This site will contain my projects in programming (provided that they're open 
      source); A page where i put my achievements, successes, failures and status in 
      life; A page where I'll write about something; And a page where I'll share 
      useful resources to appropriate audiences (programmers and hackers). 
      <br /></br />
      
      Right now, I am focusing on becoming a hacker and according to Eric Steven 
      Raymond, there are factors I need to have to become a hacker which are:
      
      <ol>
        <li>The Hacker Attitude</li>
        <li>Basic Hacking Skills</li>
        <li>Status in the Hacker Culture</li>
      </ol>
      
      I don't have time to discuss what are those and what I need to get them
      so view this page to read about <a href="www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-
      howto.html">"How To Become A Hacker"</a> By Eric Steven Raymond.
